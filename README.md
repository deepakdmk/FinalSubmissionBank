# Java Console Application

## Requirements
- **Java 11 or higher**

## Project Structure
To set up the project correctly in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA):

- Mark the following directories appropriately:
  - `src` → **Sources Root**
  - `test` → **Test Sources Root**
  - `lib` → **Resources Root** (only needed if you're running JUnit tests)

## Notes
I work on this project across both office and home environments.  
To avoid signing into GitHub on my work PC, I have opted not to use Git CLI for updates. Thus, you only see raw upload commits on my actual repo -- https://github.com/deepakdmk/BankSystem
